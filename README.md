The main function for this application is for the personal convenience of recursively copying directories according to user defined parameters. 
It will also sync directories according to the date and time last modified.  

This verion (version 2) communicates with a MSSQL server. 
It will allow you to create, save, and select profiles stored in the MSSQL server.   

Libraries, methods and classes in branches "master" and "jake" are created by myself.
